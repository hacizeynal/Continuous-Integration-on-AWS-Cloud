## Continuous Integration on AWS Cloud

In the previous [project](https://github.com/hacizeynal/Continuous-Integration-Using-Jenkins-Nexus-Sonarqube-Slack)
, we built a Continuous Integration pipeline on Jenkins and integrated it with the following tools Maven, Checkstyle, Slack, SonaType Nexus, and SonarQube. Unfortunately building and managing all those tools are requiring huge effort and overhead. We will build the same pipeline with AWS services will give us a lot of advantages such as less overhead for managing, less human input, and getting rid of managing servers.
